# 💡 Lumenix
Lumenix is an independent browser engine created from scratch in Python, built to be fast and responsive.
> [!CAUTION]
> Lumenix is a very early state, and is not suitable by use for anyone outside of contributors.

## 🔎 Features
We want to create a complete, usable browser for the modern web based on web standards.
Lumenix is currently in a very early state and will take years to make. We appreciate any and all contributions.
At the moment, core libraries are not available, but are found as:
* Lumenix - The core, handles pretty much everything except JavaScript and WebAssembly
   - **Did you know?** Lumen is Latin for light, which we use to call our engine fast 😉. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lumen" target="_blank">See definition</a>
* LuxJS - Handles JavaScript and WebAssembly, and will be available someday as a seperate package to use in other projects
   - **Did you know?** Lux is also Latin for light! <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lux" target="_blank">See definition</a>

## ⚒️ How do I build and run this?
Currently, we just use Python and Pip, so just install the latest <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python version</a>, then clone this repo with Git and run `python app.py`, this will install everything required for Lumenix/LuxJS and run immediately after.
Lumenix should run on all major operating systems. If there's an issue, please feel free to report it as an <a href="https://github.com/lumabrowser/lumenix/issues">issue</a>.
Proper documentation will be available soon.
